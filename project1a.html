    <p class="wayne">
      Wayne: When did you start using social media?
    </p>

    <p class="jeremy">
      Jeremy:Yeah, I guess I started using social media. I had My Space, I think
      I also had Friendster or something before my space. I had Friendster at
      first and then I used My Space. And I'm not using those two anymore. I
      nowadays use Instagram. I have Facebook also. Yeah.
    </p>
    <p class="wayne">
      Wayne: So how so what social media do use most often?
    </p>
    <p class="jeremy">
      Jeremy:I guess I'm more active on Instagram. And I guess I get distracted
      by Instagram more also. I check that probably more during the day, cause
      it's just so fun to check out what other things are going on. I do use
      Facebook, but I don't really post on Facebook very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Why do you use them?
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeremy:So for me I run a music recording studio. So I use it a lot for
      that. And I think it's helpful for business stuff. So my Instagram is
      focused around my recording studio and also I do electronics repair for
      old synthesizers and music equipment. So I focus a little bit more on that
      kind of stuff. So I used it maybe like four years ago or five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: So do you use it as a communication tool with others?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:So kind of since I'm using it for my music business, I'll use it to
      connect with bands, connect with other people, and studio synthesizer
      repair world plus my friends are on it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Because for me, I just view those posts, but I don't actually use
      it as a communication tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I actually use it maybe less for.. a little bit for communication.
      Like all messages with people sometimes, there's a few people there. I
      guess I use Facebook more as the communication tool end of things. But for
      Instagram maybe it's more promotion like a business promotion or just kind
      of more networking. But not a really communicative networking, just kind
      of like “hey, here's what we do”.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: So how about Facebook ?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:With Facebook, I don't really post a lot of stuff. I might post
      personal things. I might post just like vacation pictures. And like happy
      birthdays and things like that. But I use Facebook more as a messaging
      thing. I use Facebook messenger actually a lot. Cause I have a lot of
      maybe international contacts and things and it's just good quick messaging
      for that. I also use that as a mix of personal and business stuff. I do
      one thing that's useful for Facebook for me is the group's function. So
      for example, there's a group especially for technical things. For my
      recording studio, I have this like the early 1970s mixing board the giant
      thing from the studio. And there's a group for that. And I have a lot of
      experience with repairing and restoring old equipment. So those groups are
      really helpful for technical things. So I do post a lot in conversations,
      like helping people figure out technical problems and that kind of stuff.
      Or if I'm having problems, I use it for things like repairing old
      synthesizers and the keyboard, that kind of thing. And I'm in some groups
      with that. And then otherwise more just like keeping in touch with friends
      too.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you contact your family?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:With family, I do some through Facebook with some people, a little
      bit. I don't have a cousin that's really active on Instagram. So sometimes
      more through Facebook, but mostly just face timing, like with my immediate
      family. I don't really like to interact with them on social media that
      much mostly just phone or facetime. But with my more distant family, like
      my cousins or aunts and uncles, it's like Facebook first, then Instagram
      for a few.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How much time do you spend on this kind of social media?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Probably too much. It's kind of random which I think it would be
      nice to have some kind of routine because I feel like it is obviously
      distracting and I try not to do it. Like if I'm working like creating
      papers or doing administrative work, I'd like don't look at it. But I all
      end up looking at when I'm walking around or on the train or probably many
      times a day. It's saying average like 35 minutes on Instagram and 26
      minutes on Facebook. I thought it was more. I thought it was gonna be
      three hours. But maybe just like that. But I think that's the thing. Check
      it for like two minutes and then that's it. But it's two minutes, 15 times
      a day.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you feel about it?</p>
    <p>
      I generally feel like it's useful. I feel like it's easy for me to get
      distracted. It's just hard to stay focused on one thing. Cause usually
      when I'm looking at, it's like while I'm doing something else or in
      between things. and yeah, I'll be like at home watching a movie with my
      wife and just scroll through really quick. I think that kind of thing is
      bad. It's bad to take out yourself of the moment maybe. But I know it's
      everyone's problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Could you explain a feature of a social media platform you like the
      most? Facebook you have a group chat. Right? But not on Instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I do like the groups just for really specific things like people
      that have knowledge of some really specific area that’s cool on Facebook.
      I like the messaging on Facebook, it’s fast. Instagram maybe following
      tags versus people that you're actually following. So you can find more
      than you can just have your friend book. I think that's helpful, but
      that's basic feature. I know maybe half of them. Some people just people
      that randomly followed me. So it could be people that followed being
      randomly or and I thought their stuff is interesting. Or people that know
      certain kinds of equipment or things that I'm into. I might follow them
      even if I don't know them. But it's mostly people that I know in person or
      i've met have some kind of interaction with occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Do you think Instagram is important to you? Like does it affect
      your life in any aspect in like besides the distraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Yeah. I think it helps me at least feel like I know what's going on
      with my friends that live far away. I don't see it normally. I feel like I
      know a little bit more about what's going on with my old friends and
      people that don't live here. It's helpful, like I mentioned, for business
      things, for contacts. Also if I need technical help like I can get it
      faster. Then I could from just the people I know directly that I could
      call or something most people don't know a lot about, like the technical
      stuff that I do. Jeremy:I don't have a label, but it's for the recording
      studio or for especially like the repair thing, like circuits and
      electronics, like understanding that stuff, like people who have really
      specific knowledge of things, which is good. And then a little bit for
      networking for getting music work, like being in touch with bands that I
      don't know and things like that sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How about promotion?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:We get promotions a little bit. Yeah. Okay. I would like to see it
      more as a promotional tool. I've not really gotten work through it, but I
      feel like it could happen. (So most of your work didn't come from those
      social media?)No social media. No, it seems like it could, but I don't
      know. Maybe I haven't been using it for that too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: So do you have any purpose for getting work or promotion while
      using?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:That's something I’ve been trying to focus on a little bit more.
      Just kind of opening trying to promote and be like, hey, I do this kind of
      work kind of connecting with people that might be interested in that
      partner. Okay, good. So that is something that I think I'm just recently
      trying to focus on that a little bit more like how I tag things are who
      I'm adding that kind of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Do you have any limitations on the social media that you've ever
      experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Um, I don't know. That's maybe a little bit hard to tell them. I'm
      sure there is. So a lot of what I use like Facebook, for example I used to
      use message boards for, for like technical things. And there used to be
      things that are kind of archives like rare documents or more Information.
      I use Facebook groups for that thing which I think a lot of people are
      kind of moving towards from message boards who used to be on message
      boards. Now it's really hard to search. So I feel like I'm posting the
      same answers to people like 10 times instead of one time where everyone
      could find it on those kinds of systems. I think the way that Facebook has
      the group set up is not great as an archive. It's more as an immediate.
      (so you mean the archive are within the groups?) Keeping documents
      organized or having a being more easily searchable. I think this search
      functions aren't great. And obviously like another limitation to that. I
      don't like Facebook for. The reason I don't use that for business stuff is
      the pay structure is really annoying. Like if I post through my business
      account there only 13 people will see it unless I pay for people to see
      it. So cause in a business account like it won't show it to most of the
      people you're connected with unless you pay. So it's not useful unless
      you're paying for it really as a business tool. On Instagram I don't have
      that limitation, I think that makes Facebook like a little bit harder to
      use as a business unless you're expecting to spend advertising money. (So
      they do have some service like have your pictures exposed to those clients
      more?) So you can have it. But I think even with the way it works now.
      Yeah, so you can pay to have it exposed to like more people that you're
      not connected with. But even now, like, let's say if 800 people like your
      business page, most of those people won't see it if you post something
      only like a feel or unless you pay for it. And then most of those people
      will see it. So it doesn't really work like the personal one where like if
      you're active a lot of your friends will see it. So I think the pace like
      having a better free structure would be good. I used to use Facebook for
      promoting events like art shows. And I used to be involved with putting on
      art shows and music events. And those kinds of things where it's not
      really for money. It's just for promoting art and music. I don't wanna
      have to pay to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Yeah, so the recording studio is part of your job. And you also
      have another job here. How do you communicate with students or other staff
      here teachers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I guess I don't really use social media generally with students. I
      do have some of my coworkers that I know better like our friends with
      other teachers here. Some administrators I might be friends with on
      Facebook or something like that. But generally or a few old students who I
      worked really closely with. Maybe some students I may have in class and
      then I work within the learning center. Then it might be like end up
      friends with them on Facebook or something like that. But generally with
      like for anything related to new schoolwork, I think it's mostly through
      just Gmail.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you feel about gmail?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I think it's fine. It's easy to keep things organized in terms of
      work stuff. I like the drive function in the sharing as we work with like
      for administrators here we use a lot of like shared Google docs. So like
      the shared documents, I think work really well in general. Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: (So do you have ever bothered by it? Or you just happy with it?)
      Jeremy:Yes, I turned notifications off. So I don't get notifications for
      stuff that doesn't really bother me. I get like, so do you have if you see
      my email boxes, I do have a lot of spam. I guess that's not I don't have
      it showing right now, but I have a lot of unread are all the emails from
      spam things and stuff. But it's like I get a lot of emails at my work and
      my personal emails, but it doesn't really bother me. It's easy to keep
      organized.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: Do you have a certain schedule for email?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Um, not really so I think and that ends up being kind of like
      social media. It's like 30 times a day for like a minute. Usually in busy
      times, like at the beginning of the semester, I set aside a time where I'm
      like from 10 to 2, I'm gonna work on email or something like that. Or I'm
      gonna take care of all the things I have to do an email. In the middle of
      the semester, just kind of random. Whenever. Sometimes I’ll check like at
      night before I go to bed, when it's not really work time and deal with
      work emails. Then also I feel like it would be nice to have something
      maybe a more organized time system with that where I'm like, I set aside
      time that's like I'm gonna do all my email stuff now or whatever. All my
      work communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: So why do you have that routine at first but give it up in the
      middle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: I think it depends on how much there is to do. So if there's not a
      lot to do then like this, like early in the semester, at the end of the
      semester, there's enough work to do where I can do like three hours, just
      based off of communication or computer-based things. And then kind of in
      the middle of the semester, or even now, like as dropout as ending, maybe
      I'm getting only like three emails that I have to deal with in a day. So
      it's easy to deal with them fast, maybe. Or and I don't have to wait. I
      can just get things done faster rather than waiting till the next day or
      couple days after. So I think it's just the amount of work. Like it
      becomes more scattered when there are fewer things to do. So when there's
      a lot to do, it's easy to keep organized and like manage the time, I
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: How many email accounts do you have? And So how do you organize
      them? How do you feel about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I have five emails. So I have one new school account that's related
      to my administrative job. So for testing, when you took a test when you
      first started here, I have 1 email account is for that. And also for kind
      of advising students. One email is my teaching email and that's what I
      will probably email you with about our class or or email my boss here and
      other teachers from that one. And a lot of people around the university. I
      have my personal one. Um, and then I have a business. The one from a
      studio. I don't get a lot of emails. It's just like it's a lot less
      frequent than the other ones. So I have that one forward to my personal
      one. Any mail I get on my business, one goes to my personal ones. I can
      make sure I see it quickly. I think I have them all like so basically on
      my phone. They all just show up in the mail APP. But on my computer, it is
      a little bit hard to keep everything managed because there are four that I
      am using actively. So I use I have multiple browsers open most of the
      time. So I use chrome for my normal teacher account in my personal
      account. Then I use safari for my administrative account because it gets
      news having two new school accounts. The browser gets confused about who
      has permissions for what doc? And so I have to use separate browsers. And
      that's really annoying. (So when you check a phone all emails just go to
      the single one? ) It goes into a single thing. I don't really check school
      work emails that much there . It just tells me I have these emails to
      respond to later. But it can get a little bit confusing when I don't know
      immediately which email it's for.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: What kind of devices do you use for this kind of social media?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I have five emails. So I have one new school account that's related
      to my administrative job. So for testing, when you took a test when you
      first started here, I have 1 email account is for that. And also for kind
      of advising students. One email is my teaching email and that's what I
      will probably email you with about our class or or email my boss here and
      other teachers from that one. And a lot of people around the university. I

      one. Any mail I get on my business, one goes to my personal ones. I can
      make sure I see it quickly. I think I have them all like so basically on
      my phone. They all just show up in the mail APP. But on my computer, it is
      a little bit hard to keep everything managed because there are four that I

      that's really annoying. (So when you check a phone all emails just go to

      work emails that much there . It just tells me I have these emails to
      respond to later. But it can get a little bit confusing when I don't know
      immediately which email it's for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: So yeah. What kind of devices do you use for this kind of social
      media?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: Yeah, just phone and laptop. Yesterday, I think I first emailed
      you, maybe it was from my phone. I do like the phone for Google calendar a
      lot to keep things organized. So I have like the interview with you on
      there and then my tutoring and whatever other stuff I have scheduled. So I
      think I use my computers a little bit more focused, like when I use this.
      So I'm using this a little bit more intentionally. So I'm gonna do some
      work now I'm gonna use my computer. My phone is just kind of throughout
      the day. I think I probably saw your email first like before I went to
      bed, but I'm like, I’ll check my calendar in the morning. And so my phone,
      I'm looking at it on and off through the whole day, from when I wake up
      like and I'm getting ready in the morning. (But you turn off the
      notification, right? So use you are intentional). Yeah, I don't wanna get
      notifications for emails because that would just be too much. And also I
      turn off like, I don't like the pop-up emails on the computer either for
      things like Facebook and stuff like that. It gets kind of annoying. To get
      too many things. (so you do have a routine for doing that actually). Yeah,
      yeah. I would like to get some kinds of things. I wanna know like I guess
      if I get like a direct message or something I would like was like I if
      somebody messages me and like I don't message a lot in Instagram, but if
      somebody's gonna message me here I would like to know that. But I don't
      wanna know when somebody likes one of my pictures every time. I guess
      there probably is a way to get notifications for just like direct messages
      but I don't wanna get a message when somebody comments on a post or like
      some posters. (You can actually set such things?) Probably right. I'm not
      sure I just turned it off but I guess I would like to get some of them. I
      just turned it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: If you have to keep only one social media which one would you
      choose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: I guess I would probably, I don't know. It's a little bit tricky
      because I think like getting Information, I think Facebook is a little bit
      better. But I think for social aspect or networking or business promotion,
      I think instagram is better for me. So I would probably keep Instagram.
      Facebook also some of the privacy or security things are kind of a little
      bit sketchy to me. I mean, the way that they share people's Information.
      The targeted advertising is a little bit creepy sometimes. (But they also
      have on Instagram) I know they do, I know and it's also part of the same
      company. But it's not as obvious as that on Instagram. On Facebook it's
      like, I know they say they're not recording speech, but occasionally it
      does like, I feel like I'm talking. But I feel like there may be
      algorithms that are just that good that they can predict things. But I do
      feel like I'm just having a conversation about things sometimes. And then
      I start getting ads for it. (Oh My god) But I don't think I know people
      i've read things about it where apparently they're not doing that. But it
      just feels like it's almost a little bit too much for that. But I don't
      know, I still use it. And like I went through the privacy settings, but I
      don't care enough to stop using it or really be careful.

      Wayne:So for the iMessage, if you have a notification, right? So who are
      you taxing with?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: Yeah, I get text notifications. You mean just for the regular
      messaging here. That's mostly like friends and family transfer. Yeah, That
      I do wanna know when something's happening. So I get the mess like
      notifications for my calendar and for iMessages. I think that's like I do
      wanna know that stuff fast.

      Wayne: If you have a chance to have a social media only for you,what do
      you want mostly? If you have a social media only for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: I personally maybe to just be able to interact with friends in
      people that aren't physically close. People just like that don't live near
      me or that I don't see regularly. So I think it's just be able to be in
      touch with friends without calling them all the time. So sharing that kind
      of stuff. I think it's nice. I'm not sure exactly I haven't thought about
      really so much what I need that I don't have on social media, but I'm sure
      there's something that's would be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Yeah. So in terms of sharing life do you share your life frequently
      on those social media? At what moment would you have a mood that I wanna
      share something?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: Not so much. Maybe for traveling or for looking through old
      pictures or something like that. And like finding or, I don't know,
      remembering old experiences or something like that. I feel like I want to
      maybe I will get more active with that. But I don't post a lot right now
      of personal things. But it's more like I might like if somebody else posts
      something, I might like message them or comments and interact that way.
      (So is that happens frequently for you to post comments.) Liking things,
      definitely. I think I comment a lot more than I post and other people's
      stuff. I use the messenger stuff a lot more than I post too.

      Wayne:How do you define your personality when you're online and you are in
      the offline world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: I think I'm pretty consistent. I think I'm a little bit
      introverted on both. In the real world and online like I'm a little bit
      reserved. Reserved is just like not quick to share. I feel like maybe
      maybe with things that I know well I'm more confident. Maybe I'm a little
      bit more confident online, if I'm posting things that I feel like I know.
      Maybe I do have a little bit more confidence online. But I think as far as
      being introverted, extroverted, probably pretty similar on both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Do you have other kinds of social media?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy: I guess there are other social media I was using like Whatsapp
      occasionally for like when I was traveling like my wife's family's from
      Egypt, and we were traveling there. So like all of her family , they uses
      What's App. So like on that trip, I was using that a lot. So sometimes I
      might use other things but just casually.
