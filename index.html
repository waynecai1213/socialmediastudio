    <p>Teacher in the Newschool; 43 years old;</p>

    <hr />
    <p class="wayne">
      Wayne: When did you start using social media?
    </p>

    <p class="jeremy">
      Jeremy:Yeah, I guess I started using social media. I had My Space, I think
      I also had Friendster or something before my space. I had Friendster at
      first and then I used My Space. And I'm not using those two anymore. I
      nowadays use Instagram. I have Facebook also. Yeah.
    </p>
    <p class="wayne">
      Wayne: So how so what social media do use most often?
    </p>
    <p class="jeremy">
      Jeremy:I guess I'm more active on Instagram. And I guess I get distracted
      by Instagram more also. I check that probably more during the day, cause
      it's just so fun to check out what other things are going on. I do use
      Facebook, but I don't really post on Facebook very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Why do you use them?
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeremy:So for me I run a music recording studio. So I use it a lot for
      that. And I think it's helpful for business stuff. So my Instagram is
      focused around my recording studio and also I do electronics repair for
      old synthesizers and music equipment. So I focus a little bit more on that
      kind of stuff. So I used it maybe like four years ago or five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: So do you use it as a communication tool with others?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:So kind of since I'm using it for my music business, I'll use it to
      connect with bands, connect with other people, and studio synthesizer
      repair world plus my friends are on it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Because for me, I just view those posts, but I don't actually use
      it as a communication tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I actually use it maybe less for.. a little bit for communication.
      Like all messages with people sometimes, there's a few people there. I
      guess I use Facebook more as the communication tool end of things. But for
      Instagram maybe it's more promotion like a business promotion or just kind
      of more networking. But not a really communicative networking, just kind
      of like “hey, here's what we do”.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: So how about Facebook ?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:With Facebook, I don't really post a lot of stuff. I might post
      personal things. I might post just like vacation pictures. And like happy
      birthdays and things like that. But I use Facebook more as a messaging
      thing. I use Facebook messenger actually a lot. Cause I have a lot of
      maybe international contacts and things and it's just good quick messaging
      for that. I also use that as a mix of personal and business stuff. I do
      one thing that's useful for Facebook for me is the group's function. So
      for example, there's a group especially for technical things. For my
      recording studio, I have this like the early 1970s mixing board the giant
      thing from the studio. And there's a group for that. And I have a lot of
      experience with repairing and restoring old equipment. So those groups are
      really helpful for technical things. So I do post a lot in conversations,
      like helping people figure out technical problems and that kind of stuff.
      Or if I'm having problems, I use it for things like repairing old
      synthesizers and the keyboard, that kind of thing. And I'm in some groups
      with that. And then otherwise more just like keeping in touch with friends
      too.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you contact your family?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:With family, I do some through Facebook with some people, a little
      bit. I don't have a cousin that's really active on Instagram. So sometimes
      more through Facebook, but mostly just face timing, like with my immediate
      family. I don't really like to interact with them on social media that
      much mostly just phone or facetime. But with my more distant family, like
      my cousins or aunts and uncles, it's like Facebook first, then Instagram
      for a few.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How much time do you spend on this kind of social media?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Probably too much. It's kind of random which I think it would be
      nice to have some kind of routine because I feel like it is obviously
      distracting and I try not to do it. Like if I'm working like creating
      papers or doing administrative work, I'd like don't look at it. But I all
      end up looking at when I'm walking around or on the train or probably many
      times a day. It's saying average like 35 minutes on Instagram and 26
      minutes on Facebook. I thought it was more. I thought it was gonna be
      three hours. But maybe just like that. But I think that's the thing. Check
      it for like two minutes and then that's it. But it's two minutes, 15 times
      a day.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you feel about it?</p>
    <p>
      I generally feel like it's useful. I feel like it's easy for me to get
      distracted. It's just hard to stay focused on one thing. Cause usually
      when I'm looking at, it's like while I'm doing something else or in
      between things. and yeah, I'll be like at home watching a movie with my
      wife and just scroll through really quick. I think that kind of thing is
      bad. It's bad to take out yourself of the moment maybe. But I know it's
      everyone's problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Could you explain a feature of a social media platform you like the
      most? Facebook you have a group chat. Right? But not on Instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I do like the groups just for really specific things like people
      that have knowledge of some really specific area that’s cool on Facebook.
      I like the messaging on Facebook, it’s fast. Instagram maybe following
      tags versus people that you're actually following. So you can find more
      than you can just have your friend book. I think that's helpful, but
      that's basic feature. I know maybe half of them. Some people just people
      that randomly followed me. So it could be people that followed being
      randomly or and I thought their stuff is interesting. Or people that know
      certain kinds of equipment or things that I'm into. I might follow them
      even if I don't know them. But it's mostly people that I know in person or
      i've met have some kind of interaction with occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Do you think Instagram is important to you? Like does it affect
      your life in any aspect in like besides the distraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Yeah. I think it helps me at least feel like I know what's going on
      with my friends that live far away. I don't see it normally. I feel like I
      know a little bit more about what's going on with my old friends and
      people that don't live here. It's helpful, like I mentioned, for business
      things, for contacts. Also if I need technical help like I can get it
      faster. Then I could from just the people I know directly that I could
      call or something most people don't know a lot about, like the technical
      stuff that I do. Jeremy:I don't have a label, but it's for the recording
      studio or for especially like the repair thing, like circuits and
      electronics, like understanding that stuff, like people who have really
      specific knowledge of things, which is good. And then a little bit for
      networking for getting music work, like being in touch with bands that I
      don't know and things like that sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How about promotion?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:We get promotions a little bit. Yeah. Okay. I would like to see it
      more as a promotional tool. I've not really gotten work through it, but I
      feel like it could happen. (So most of your work didn't come from those
      social media?)No social media. No, it seems like it could, but I don't
      know. Maybe I haven't been using it for that too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: So do you have any purpose for getting work or promotion while
      using?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:That's something I’ve been trying to focus on a little bit more.
      Just kind of opening trying to promote and be like, hey, I do this kind of
      work kind of connecting with people that might be interested in that
      partner. Okay, good. So that is something that I think I'm just recently
      trying to focus on that a little bit more like how I tag things are who
      I'm adding that kind of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Do you have any limitations on the social media that you've ever
      experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Um, I don't know. That's maybe a little bit hard to tell them. I'm
      sure there is. So a lot of what I use like Facebook, for example I used to
      use message boards for, for like technical things. And there used to be
      things that are kind of archives like rare documents or more Information.
      I use Facebook groups for that thing which I think a lot of people are
      kind of moving towards from message boards who used to be on message
      boards. Now it's really hard to search. So I feel like I'm posting the
      same answers to people like 10 times instead of one time where everyone
      could find it on those kinds of systems. I think the way that Facebook has
      the group set up is not great as an archive. It's more as an immediate.
      (so you mean the archive are within the groups?) Keeping documents
      organized or having a being more easily searchable. I think this search
      functions aren't great. And obviously like another limitation to that. I
      don't like Facebook for. The reason I don't use that for business stuff is
      the pay structure is really annoying. Like if I post through my business
      account there only 13 people will see it unless I pay for people to see
      it. So cause in a business account like it won't show it to most of the
      people you're connected with unless you pay. So it's not useful unless
      you're paying for it really as a business tool. On Instagram I don't have
      that limitation, I think that makes Facebook like a little bit harder to
      use as a business unless you're expecting to spend advertising money. (So
      they do have some service like have your pictures exposed to those clients
      more?) So you can have it. But I think even with the way it works now.
      Yeah, so you can pay to have it exposed to like more people that you're
      not connected with. But even now, like, let's say if 800 people like your
      business page, most of those people won't see it if you post something
      only like a feel or unless you pay for it. And then most of those people
      will see it. So it doesn't really work like the personal one where like if
      you're active a lot of your friends will see it. So I think the pace like
      having a better free structure would be good. I used to use Facebook for
      promoting events like art shows. And I used to be involved with putting on
      art shows and music events. And those kinds of things where it's not
      really for money. It's just for promoting art and music. I don't wanna
      have to pay to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: Yeah, so the recording studio is part of your job. And you also
      have another job here. How do you communicate with students or other staff
      here teachers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I guess I don't really use social media generally with students. I
      do have some of my coworkers that I'm I know better like our friends with
      other teachers here. Some administrators I might be friends with on
      Facebook or something like that. But generally or a few old students who I
      worked really closely with. Maybe some students I may have in class and
      then I work within the learning center. Then it might be like end up
      friends with them on Facebook or something like that. But generally with
      like for anything like related to new schoolwork, it's all like just
      through, I think it's pretty much mostly through just like Gmail or okay,
      yeah, so glad.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: How do you feel about gmail?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:I think it's fine. It's easy to keep things organized in terms of
      work stuff. I like the drive function in the sharing as we work with like
      for administrators here we use a lot of like shared Google docs. So like
      the shared documents, I think work really well in general. Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
      (So do you have ever bothered by it? Or you just happy with it?)
      Jeremy:Yes, I turned notifications off. So I don't get notifications for
      stuff that doesn't really bother me. I get like, so do you have if you see
      my email boxes, I do have I get a lot of spam to. I guess that's not I
      don't have it showing right now, but I have a lot of unread are all the
      emails from like spam things and stuff. But it's like I get a lot of
      emails at my work and my personal emails, but it doesn't really bother me.
      It's easy to keep organized.
    </p>
    <p>Wayne: Do you have a certain time for checking it?</p>
    <p>
      Jeremy:Um, not really so I think and that ends up being kind of like
      social media. It's like 30 times a day for like a minute. Usually in busy
      times, like at the beginning of the semester, I set aside a time where I'm
      like from 10 to 2, I'm gonna work on email or something like that. Or I'm
      gonna take care of all the things I have to do an email. Um, in the middle
      of the semester, just kind of random. Whenever. And I do also check.
      Sometimes I’ll check like at night before I go to bed, when it's not
      really like work time and deal with work emails. Then also I feel like it
      would be nice to have something like maybe a more organized time system
      with that where I'm like, I set aside like time. That's like I'm gonna do
      all my email stuff now or whatever. All my work communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne: So why do you have that routine at first but give it up in the
      middle?.
    </p>
    <p>Jeremy:I think it depends on how much there is to do. So if there's not a lot to do then like this, like early in the semester, at the end of the semester, there's enough work to do where I can do like three hours, just based off of communication or computer-based things. And then kind of in the middle of the semester, or even now, like as dropout as ending, maybe I'm getting only like three emails that I have to deal with in a day. So it's like it doesn't it's easy to deal with them fast, maybe. Or and I don't have to wait. I can just get things done faster rather than waiting till the next day or the couple days after. So I think it's just the amount of work like it becomes more scattered when there are fewer things to do. So when there's a lot to do, it's easy to keep organized and like manage the time, I think. 
</p>
    <p>Wayne: How many email accounts do you have? And So how do you organize them?  How do you feel about it?</p>
    <p>Jeremy:I have five emails, five. Um. Okay, so my, so I have one new school account that's related to my administrative job. So for testing, when you took a test when you first started here, I have 11 email accounts for that. And also for kind of advising students. One email is my teaching email and that's what I will probably email you with about our class or or email like my boss hear other teachers from that one. And a lot of people around the university are that um, I have my personal one. Um, and then I have a business, one, the business, the one from a studio. I don't get a lot of emails. It's just like it's a lot less frequent than the other ones. So I have that one forward to my personal one, Any mail I get on my business, one goes to my personal ones. I can make sure I see it quickly. Um, the work ones. I think I have them all like so basically on my phone. They all just show up in the mail APP. But on my computer, it is a little bit hard to keep everything managed because it's amusing actively. So I use I have multiple browsers open most of the time. So I use chrome for my normal teacher account in my personal account. Then I use safari for my AD administrative account because it gets news having two new school accounts. The browser gets confused about who has permissions for what? Doc? And so I have to use separate browsers. And that's really annoying. So when you check a phone like all email go just going to the the ones a sing it goes into a single thing. I don't really check school work emails that much there because then um, but it' more just tells me I have these emails to deal to respond to later. But I can get a little bit confusing when I don't know. Um, immediately like which email. It's for god. 
</p>
    <p>Wayne: So yeah. What kind of devices do you use for this kind of social media?</p>
    <p>Jeremy:yeah, just phone and laptop. um, yesterday, I think I first emailed you, maybe it was from my phone. I do like the phone for, I use the Google calendar a lot on my phone to keep things organized. So I have like the interview with you on there and then my tutoring and like whatever other stuff I have scheduled. So I think I use my computers a little bit more focused, like when I use this. So I'm using this a little bit more intentionally. So I'm gonna do some work now I'm gonna use my computer. My phone is just kind of throughout the day, like, I think I probably saw your email first like before I went to bed, but I'm like, I’ll check my calendar in the morning or something. And then so my phone, I'm looking at it like on and off through the whole day, like from when I wake up like and I'm getting ready in the morning, like, but you turn off the notification, right? So use you are intentionally. Yeah,  I don't wanna get notifications for emails because that would just be too much. And also I turn off like, I don't like the pop-up emails on the computer either for things like Facebook and stuff like that. It gets kind of annoying. Um, to get too many things. So you yeah, so the things that you do have a little thing for doing that galley. Yeah, yeah. I I would like to get some kinds of things. Like, I I wanna know like I guess if I get like a direct message or something I would like was like I if somebody messages me and like I don't message a lot in Instagram, but if like somebody's gonna like message me here like I would like to know that but I don't wanna know when like somebody likes one of my pictures every time or something like that. Like news on Instagram whole union I guess using Instagram and Facebook. I guess there probably is a way to get notifications for just like some things like direct messages but like I don't wanna get a message when like somebody like comments on a post or like some posters or you can actually set such that I think so. Probably right. Almost like I'm not sure I just turned it off but I I guess I would like to get some of them, but I don't. Okay, I just turned it off. So both Facebook and Instagram, they have no, I don't know. I didn't really look enough. All right, I I guess like, yeah, yeah. 
</p>
    <p>Wayne: If you have to keep only one social media which one would you choose? </p>
    <p>Jeremy:I guess I would I would probably, I don't know. It's a little bit tricky because I think like for like getting Information, I think Facebook is a little bit better. But I think for like the kind of social aspect or networking or business promotion, I think in screams better for me. So I would probably keep Instagram I Facebook also like some of the privacy or security things are kind of like a little bit sketchy to me. Sometimes I just like, I mean, the way that they share people's Information. the targeted advertising is a little bit creepy sometimes. But they also have, I know they do, I know and it's also part of the same company, but it doesn't it's not as like I think it's not as obvious. And Instagram. Yeah, where? On Facebook it's like, I know like they say they're not recording like speech, but occasionally like it does like, I feel like I'm talking. Well, but I feel like I may be their algorithms are just that good that they can predict like things. But I do feel like I'm just having a conversation about things sometimes. And then I start getting ads for it. My god! But I don't think I no people i've read things about it where like apparently they're not doing that. But but it just feels like it's almost a little bit too much for that, okay. But I don't know, I still use it. And like I went through the privacy settings, but I don't care enough to like, stop using it or really be careful. Okay, and yeah, so for the I message, if you have a notification, right for you, sure. Yeah, I get text notifications. So who are you taxing wage? What kind of people are you feeling cool? You mean just for the regular messaging, like here I that's mostly like friends and family transfer. Yeah, That I do wanna know like when something's happening. So I get the mess like notifications for like my calendar and for like messages like I message, I think that's like I do wanna know that stuff fast.
</p>
    <p>Wayne: If you have a chance to have a social media only for you,what do you want? 
</p>
    <p>Jeremy:Mostly if you have a social media only for you, Yeah, I personally it's just more important to like be able to kid like maybe to just be able to interact with friends like in people that aren't physically close on the physically people just like that I don't see like don't live near me or that I don't see regularly. So I think it's just like be able to be in touch like feel like I'm in touch with friends without calling them all the time. So all kind of still sharing sharing like that kind of stuff. I think it's nice, I'm not sure exactly like I haven't thought about like really so much what I need that I don't have on social media, but I'm sure there's something that's would be good. Yeah. So in terms of sharing life do actually I share your life frequently in those on the social media. not so much. so when, like in what moment would you have a move that I wanna say something maybe for traveling or for looking through old pictures or something like that. And like finding or like, I don't know, remembering old experiences or something like that, that kind of thing. Um. I feel like I want to maybe I will get more active with that. But I I I don't post a lot right now of like personal things, but it's more like I might like if somebody else pose something, I might like message them or like comments and like interact that way. So is that good is to happen frequently for you to code post comments. And like some things. Definitely comments. I think I a I comment a lot more than I post and other people's stuff. I use the messenger stuff a lot more than I post too. So yeah, in yeah We see. I think we kind of cover all of them cold. Yeah. Ok. Anything else? You're wondering about her. I because I didn't use the Facebook that much for Instagram. for me.
</p>
    <p>Wayne:How do you define your personality when you're online and you are in the offline world?</p>
    <p>Jeremy: I think I'm pretty consistent. I think I'm a little bit introverted on both in the real world Online like I'm a little bit reserved, or maybe like reserve is reserved is just like not not quick to share or not like.  I feel like maybe maybe with things that I know like I'm more confident, maybe maybe I'm a little bit more confident online. Like if I'm posting things about like that, I feel like I know so maybe there is a little bit more like maybe I do have like a a little bit more like confidence online, but I think as far as like being introverted, extroverted, probably pretty similar on both in when the questions product, yeah. Do you think, um, think it's very much it. But yeah, so do you have other kind of social media mean you share like this Facebook and Instagram or the other. That's kind of all that. 

So know if I was committed. I  guess like, no, I don't there's occasionally I guess there are other social media like, um, I was using like what's up occasionally for like when I was traveling like my wife's family's from Egypt, and we were traveling there. So like all of her family there uses What's App. So like on that trip, I was using that a lot. So sometimes I might use other things like, but just for casually for the period. Yeah, exactly.
