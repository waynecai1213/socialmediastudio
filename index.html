      Wayne: When did you start using social media?
    </p>

    <p class="jeremy">
      Jeremy:Yeah, I guess I started using social media. I had My Space, I think
      I also had Friendster or something before my space. I had Friendster at
      first and then I used My Space. And I'm not using those two anymore. I
      nowadays use Instagram. I have Facebook also. Yeah.

  <p class="wayne">
      Wayne: So how so what social media do use most often? 

    </p>
 <p class="jeremy">
  Jeremy:I guess I'm more active on Instagram. And I guess I get distracted by Instagram more also. I check that probably more during the day, cause it's just so fun to check out what other things are going on. I do use Facebook, but I don't really post on Facebook very much.
