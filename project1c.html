      Feedback from Jeremy:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        He likes how this social media is focused on his social closeness with
        others.
      </li>
      <li>
        He thought the function of sorting friends and newest posts into
        catagories could help him focus on those parts and not get distracted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jeremy was a little confused at the action of contacting phone because
        of my way of presenting different scenario of using this social media.
        But he understood quickly after my explaination.
      </li>
      <li>
        May explain the duration of time and the amount of times more clearly
        and distinct.
      </li>
    </ul>
